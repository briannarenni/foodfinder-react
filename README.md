# FoodFinderClient

*I originally made this client app [in Angular](https://github.com/briannarenni/FoodFinderAng). I wanted to use the same project to learn the basics of React next.*

## App description
[FoodFinder](https://briannarenni.github.io/foodfinder-react/) initially loads and fetches an array of restaurant objects [from my own API](https://github.com/briannarenni/FoodFinderAPI). App waits for that data before rendering the Home component. Home controls the state of that data, and the Navbar component allows for sorting and filtering of the data. Each restaurant also has its own menu in a react--bootstrap Modal.

### Notes 
This project has given me a much greater understanding of how powerful the React Hooks feature is, how they update state to control re-rendering, and how a development process varies between Angular and React. I also deployed to Github Pages in less than 5 minutes with [this handy walkthrough](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
